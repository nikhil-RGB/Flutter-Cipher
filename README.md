## Description

This project consists of a flutter cipher, which uses a variation of a simple caeser cipher application to cipher plain text into a human-unreadable format.
This cipher is a simple fun project which allows textual information to be passed between two parties or stored in a human-unreadable format.
Ciphered text can be read by switching to the decipher mode and deciphering the text.
<br/><br/>
Later releases include the abilty to have  Ciphered texts  optionally  protected with passwords which ensure that not everyone who has access to the app can decipher sensitive textual information without the message password.
<br/><br/>
This app also has a [desktop application](https://github.com/nikhil-RGB/Shuffle-Cipher-Desktop) version and a [webpage version](https://github.com/nikhil-RGB/Shuffle-Cipher-Web)!
